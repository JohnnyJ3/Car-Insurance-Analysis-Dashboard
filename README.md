- Average Claim Amount: $5,000

##  Insights
- Commercial vehicles generate 3x higher claims than private ($137M vs $51M).
- Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge dominate high-value claims (>$9M each).
- Highly Urban zones account for 28.2% of claims despite smaller policy base.

##  Recommendations
1. Increase premiums for commercial vehicles & high-risk makes (Ford, Chevy, Dodge).
2. Target risk mitigation programs in *Highly Urban* zones.
3. Offer discounts for married policyholders & higher education levels.
4. Launch telematics for young drivers (18–30) in urban areas.
5. Adjust pricing models to reflect rising claim trend post-2010.

##  Conclusion
This analysis reveals commercial use, urban density, and low education* as top risk predictors. Strategic pricing and targeted interventions can reduce claim severity by 15–20% while improving portfolio profitability.
